# GuessTheNumber
This code generates a random number from 1 to 100, prompts the user to enter their guess, and tells them whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low. It limits the number of attempts to 5 per round and has 3 rounds in total. It also adds points based on the number of attempts left and displays the final score at the end of the game.
